# Inter-Worker Communication Implementation

This document describes the implementation of inter-worker communication via gRPC streaming for the Mini Data Cloud project.

## Overview

The implementation provides a comprehensive solution for inter-worker communication using gRPC streaming, Arrow RecordBatch serialization, retry logic, and shuffle operations for distributed joins.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Protocol Buffer Definitions

**File**: `proto/data_exchange.proto`

Defines the gRPC service and message types for inter-worker communication:

- `DataExchangeService`: Main gRPC service for data exchange
- `DataChunk`: Message for streaming Arrow RecordBatch data
- `ArrowSchema`: Schema information for data validation
- `DataTransferResponse`: Response for data transfer operations
- `PartitionInfo`: Information about available data partitions
- `ShuffleConfig`: Configuration for shuffle operations
- `RetryConfig`: Configuration for retry logic

Key features:
- Streaming support for large datasets
- Compression options (LZ4, Snappy, ZSTD)
- Checksum validation for data integrity
- Schema compatibility checking

### 2. Data Exchange Service Interface

**File**: `minicloud-worker/src/main/java/com/minicloud/worker/service/DataExchangeService.java`

Defines the service interface for data exchange operations:

- `sendDataToWorker()`: Send Arrow data to another worker
- `requestDataFromWorker()`: Request data from another worker
- `storeIntermediateResults()`: Store intermediate results for access
- `getAvailablePartitions()`: Get available partitions for a query stage
- `performHashShuffle()`: Perform hash-based shuffle operation
- `performBroadcast()`: Perform broadcast operation to all workers
- `cleanupQueryData()`: Clean up intermediate results

### 3. Data Exchange Service Implementation

**File**: `minicloud-worker/src/main/java/com/minicloud/worker/service/DataExchangeServiceImpl.java`

Implements the data exchange service with:

- Asynchronous data transfer using CompletableFuture
- Intermediate result storage using ConcurrentHashMap
- Integration with Arrow serialization utilities
- Retry logic for failed operations
- Hash shuffle and broadcast operations

### 4. Arrow Serialization Utilities

**File**: `minicloud-worker/src/main/java/com/minicloud/worker/util/ArrowSerializationUtil.java`

Provides utilities for Arrow RecordBatch serialization:

- `serializeToChunks()`: Serialize VectorSchemaRoot to DataChunks
- `deserializeFromChunks()`: Deserialize DataChunks back to VectorSchemaRoot
- `serializeSchema()` / `deserializeSchema()`: Schema serialization
- `hashPartitionData()`: Hash-based data partitioning
- `estimateDataSize()`: Data size estimation
- Checksum calculation for data integrity

### 5. Retry Utilities

**File**: `minicloud-worker/src/main/java/com/minicloud/worker/util/RetryUtil.java`

Implements retry logic with exponential backoff:

- Configurable retry attempts and delays
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Predicate-based retry conditions
- Support for both Callable and Runnable operations
- Built-in detection of retryable exceptions (network issues, timeouts)

### 6. gRPC Service Implementation

**File**: `minicloud-worker/src/main/java/com/minicloud/worker/grpc/DataExchangeGrpcServiceImpl.java`

Implements the gRPC DataExchangeService:

- `streamData()`: Bidirectional streaming for data exchange
- `requestData()`: Handle data requests from other workers
- `sendResults()`: Receive intermediate results from other workers
- `getAvailablePartitions()`: Provide partition information
- Session tracking and error handling

### 7. Worker-to-Worker Client

**File**: `minicloud-worker/src/main/java/com/minicloud/worker/grpc/WorkerToWorkerClient.java`

Provides client functionality for worker-to-worker communication:

- Connection management with channel caching
- Async data transfer operations
- Bidirectional streaming support
- Retry logic integration
- Connection lifecycle management

## Key Features

### 1. Data Exchange Service for Intermediate Results

- **Storage**: In-memory storage of intermediate results using ConcurrentHashMap
- **Retrieval**: Efficient partition-based data access
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of query data after completion
- **Metadata**: Rich partition information including row counts and schema

### 2. Arrow RecordBatch Serialization over gRPC

- **Chunking**: Large datasets split into manageable chunks (4MB default)
- **Streaming**: Support for streaming large result sets
- **Compression**: Optional compression (LZ4, Snappy, ZSTD)
- **Integrity**: Checksum validation for each chunk
- **Schema**: Schema serialization and compatibility checking

### 3. Retry Logic for Failed Communications

- **Exponential Backoff**: Configurable backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
- **Smart Detection**: Automatic detection of retryable vs. non-retryable errors
- **Configurable**: Customizable retry attempts, delays, and conditions
- **Network Resilience**: Handles connection timeouts, network partitions, and temporary failures

### 4. Shuffle Operations for Distributed Joins

- **Hash Shuffle**: Partition data based on hash of specified columns
- **Broadcast**: Send same data to all target workers
- **Round Robin**: Distribute data evenly across workers
- **Range Shuffle**: Partition data based on value ranges (future enhancement)

## Integration Points

### Control Plane Integration

The data exchange service integrates with the existing control plane through:

- Query execution coordination
- Worker registration and discovery
- Partition assignment and load balancing
- Error reporting and monitoring

### Query Engine Integration

The service supports distributed query execution by:

- Providing intermediate result storage
- Enabling data shuffling between query stages
- Supporting broadcast joins for small tables
- Facilitating result aggregation across workers

## Testing

### Integration Tests

**File**: `minicloud-worker/src/test/java/com/minicloud/worker/grpc/DataExchangeIntegrationTest.java`

Comprehensive test suite covering:

- Arrow serialization and deserialization
- Schema compatibility
- Intermediate result storage and retrieval
- Hash partitioning operations
- Async data transfer operations
- Broadcast and shuffle operations
- Data cleanup functionality

## Configuration

### gRPC Configuration

- **Message Size**: 32MB maximum message size for large Arrow batches
- **Keep Alive**: 30-second keep-alive with 5-second timeout
- **Channels**: Connection pooling and reuse
- **Security**: Plain text for development, TLS for production

### Performance Tuning

- **Chunk Size**: 4MB default chunk size for optimal network utilization
- **Thread Pools**: Configurable thread pools for async operations
