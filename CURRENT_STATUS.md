# Mini Data Cloud - Current Status

## ✅ **WORKING NOW** - Task 1 Complete

### 🚀 **What you can run:**

```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean install -DskipTests

# Run control plane (Terminal 1)
cd minicloud-control-plane
mvn spring-boot:run
# Starts on http://localhost:8080

# Run worker (Terminal 2)
cd minicloud-worker
mvn spring-boot:run
# Starts on http://localhost:8081

# Test both automatically
./test-startup.sh
```

### 🔍 **Available endpoints:**

- **Control Plane**: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
- **Worker**: http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
- **Metrics**: `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/info`

### 🏗️ **Project structure:**

```

├── proto/                    # gRPC service definitions ✅
├── minicloud-common/         # Shared models + generated stubs ✅
├── minicloud-control-plane/  # Control plane service ✅

└── data/                     # Data directory ✅
```

### 🧪 **Tests passing:**

- Protocol Buffer generation ✅
- Maven multi-module build ✅
- Spring Boot startup ✅
- Health endpoints ✅
- Basic integration tests ✅

## ❌ **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED** - Needs Task 2+

### 🚧 **Missing functionality:**

- **No SQL query API** - `/api/v1/query` endpoint doesn't exist
- **No query processing** - Can't execute `SELECT * FROM table`
- **No gRPC services** - Protocol definitions exist but no implementations
- **No data storage** - No tables, no Parquet files, no Iceberg
- **No worker communication** - Workers can't talk to control plane

### 🐳 **Docker limitations:**

- Containers start but have minimal functionality
- No actual distributed query processing
- Missing service discovery and communication

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

**Task 2: Implement Phase 1 - Single-node SQL engine**

- Add REST API for SQL queries
- Implement basic SQL parsing with Calcite
- Add in-memory query execution
- Create simple table management

**Task 3+: Add distributed features**

- gRPC service implementations
- Worker-to-control-plane communication
- Distributed query execution
- Iceberg table format integration

---

## 🎉 **Summary:**

**You have a solid, working foundation!**

The project builds, starts, and responds to health checks. All the infrastructure is in place for a distributed database system. You just need to implement the actual database functionality in the next tasks.

This is exactly what Task 1 was supposed to deliver - the project structure and core interfaces are complete and working.
